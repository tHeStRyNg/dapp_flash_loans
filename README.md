## Technology Stack & Tools

- Solidity (Writing Smart Contract)
- Javascript (React & Testing)
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) (Development Framework)
- [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) (Blockchain Interaction)
- [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) (Blockchain Connection)
- [Balancer](https://balancer.fi/) (Flash Loan Provider)

## Requirements For Initial Setup
- Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). We recommend using the latest LTS (Long-Term-Support) version, and preferably installing NodeJS via [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#intro).
- Create an [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) account, you'll need to create an app for the Ethereum chain, on the mainnet network

## Setting Up
### 1. Clone/Download the Repository

### 2. Install Dependencies:
`npm install`

### 3. Create and Setup .env
Before running any scripts, you'll want to create a .env file with the following values (see .env.example):

- **ALCHEMY_API_KEY=""**
- **ARB_FOR="0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2"** (By default we are using WETH)
- **ARB_AGAINST="0x95aD61b0a150d79219dCF64E1E6Cc01f0B64C4cE"** (By default we are using SHIB)
- **PRIVATE_KEY=""** (Private key of the account to recieve profit/execute arbitrage contract)
- **PRICE_DIFFERENCE=0.50** (Difference in price between Uniswap & Sushiswap, default is 0.50%)
- **UNITS=0** (Only used for price reporting)
- **GAS_LIMIT=400000** (Currently a hardcoded value, may need to adjust during testing)
- **GAS_PRICE=0.00000006** (60 Gwei, Currently a hardcoded value, may need to adjust during testing)

### 4. Start Hardhat Node:
In your terminal run:
`npx hardhat node`

Once you've started the hardhat node, copy the private key of the first account as you'll need to paste it in your .env file in the next step.

*As a reminder, do **NOT** use or fund the accounts/keys provided by the hardhat node in a real production setting, they are to be only used in your local testing!*

### 5. Add Private Key to .env
Copy the private key of the first account provided from the hardhat node, and paste in the value for the **PRIVATE_KEY** variable in your .env file

### 6. Deploy Smart Contract
In a separate terminal run:
`npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost`

Sometimes the deployed address may be different when testing, and therefore you'll need to update the **ARBITRAGE_ADDRESS** inside of the *config.json* 

### 7. Start the Bot
`node bot.js`

### 8. Manipulate Price
In another terminal run:
`npx hardhat run scripts/manipulate.js --network localhost`

## About config.json
Inside the *config.json* file, under the PROJECT_SETTINGS object, there are 2 keys that hold a boolean value:
- isLocal
- isDeployed

Both options depend on how you wish to test the bot. By default both values are set to true. If you set isLocal to false, and then run the bot this 
will allow the bot to monitor swap events on the actual mainnet, instead of locally. 

isDeployed's value can be set on whether you wish for the abritrage contract to be called if a potential trade is found. By default isDeployed is
set to true for local testing. Ideally this is helpful if you want to monitor swaps on mainnet and you don't have a contract deployed. 
This will allow you to still experiment with finding potential abitrage opportunites. 

## Testing Bot on Mainnet
For monitoring prices and detecting potential arbitrage opportunities, you do not need to deploy the contract. 

### 1. Edit config.json
Inside the *config.json* file, set **isDeployed** to **false** and **isLocal** to **false**.

### 2. Create and Setup .env
See step #4 in **Setting Up**

### 3. Run the bot
`node bot.js`

Keep in mind you'll need to wait for an actual swap event to be triggered before it checks the price.

## Anatomy of bot.js
The bot is essentially composed of 5 functions.
- *main()*
- *checkPrice()*
- *determineDirection()*
- *determineProfitability()*
- *executeTrade()*

The *main()* function monitors swap events from both Uniswap & Sushiswap. 

When a swap event occurs, it calls *checkPrice()*, this function will log the current price of the assets on both Uniswap & Sushiswap, and return the **priceDifference**

Then *determineDirection()* is called, this will determine where we would need to buy first, then sell. This function will return an array called **routerPath** in *main()*. The array contains Uniswap & Sushiswap's router contracts. If no array is returned, this means the **priceDifference** returned earlier is not higher than **difference**

If **routerPath** is not null, then we move into *determineProfitability()*. This is where we set our conditions on whether there is a potential arbitrage or not. This function returns either true or false.

If true is returned from *determineProfitability()*, then we call *executeTrade()* where we make our call to our arbitrage contract to perform the trade. Afterwards a report is logged, and the bot resumes to monitoring for swap events.

### Modifying & Testing the Scripts
Both the *manipulate.js* and *bot.js* has been setup to easily make some modifications easy. Before the main() function in *manipulate.js*, there will be a comment: **// -- CONFIGURE VALUES HERE -- //**. Below that will be some constants you'll be able to modify such as the unlocked account, and the amount of tokens you'll want that account to spent in order to manipulate price (You'll need to adjust this if you are looking to test different pairs).

For *bot.js*, you'd want to take a look at the function near line 132 called *determineProfitability()*. Inside this function we can set our conditions and do our calculations to determine whether we may have a potential profitable trade on our hands. This function is to return **true** if a profitable trade is possible, and **false** if not.

Note if you are doing an arbitrage for a different ERC20 token than the one in the provided example (WETH), then you may also need to adjust profitability reporting in the *executeTrade()* function.

Keep in mind, after running the scripts, specifically *manipulate.js*, you may need to restart your hardhat node, and re-deploy contracts to properly retest.

### Additional Information
The *bot.js* script uses helper functions for fetching token pair addresses, calculating price of assets, and calculating estimated returns. These functions can be found in the *helper.js* file inside of the helper folder.

The helper folder also has *server.js* which is responsible for spinning up a local server, and *initialization.js* which is responsible for setting up our blockchain connection, configuring Uniswap/Sushiswap contracts, etc. 

As you customize parts of the script it's best to refer to [Uniswap documentation](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v2/concepts/protocol-overview/how-uniswap-works) for a more detail rundown on the protocol and interacting with the V2 exchange.

### Strategy Overview and Potential Errors
The current strategy implemented is only shown as an example alongside with the *manipulate.js* script. After we manipulate price on Uniswap, we fetch the reserves on Uniswap & Sushiswap and determine the lower SHIB amount by dividing the lower amount by half. Based off of the strategy you plan and test, dividing by half may not be the most optimal. You will need to play around with your strategy. We recommend looking into how Uniswap V2 reserves work, in addition to how getAmountsIn & getAmountsOut work:

- [getReserves](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v2/reference/smart-contracts/pair#getreserves)
- [getAmountsOut](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v2/reference/smart-contracts/library#getamountsout)
- [getAmountsIn](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v2/reference/smart-contracts/library#getamountsin)

In the case of error handling, *determineProfitability()* currently has a try/catch implemented. Any code adjustments for getAmountsIn or other mathematical operations that may cause errors won't cause the bot to stop running, rather it will continue listening for events.

## Using other EVM chains
If you are looking to test on an EVM compatible chain, you can follow these steps:

### 1. Update .env

- **ARB_FOR=""** 
- **ARB_AGAINST=""**

Token addresses will be different on different chains, you'll want to reference blockchain explorers such as [Polyscan](https://polygonscan.com/) for Polygon for token addresses you want to test.

### 2. Update config.json

- **V2_ROUTER_02_ADDRESS=""** 
- **FACTORY_ADDRESS=""**

You'll want to update the router and factory addresses inside of the *config.json* file with the V2 exchanges you want to use. Based on the exchange you want to use, refer to the documentation for it's address.

### 3. Change RPC URL

Inside of *initialization.js*, you'll want to update the websocket RPC URL. Example of Polygon:
```
provider = new hre.ethers.providers.WebSocketProvider(`wss://polygon-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/${process.env.ALCHEMY_API_KEY}`)
```

Inside of *hardhat.config.js*, you'll want to update the forking URL. Example of Polygon:
```
url: `https://polygon-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/${process.env.ALCHEMY_API_KEY}`,
```

### 4. Changing Arbitrage.sol
You may also need to change the flashloan provider used in the contract to one that is available on your chain of choice. Currently Balancer seems to support the following chains:
- Ethereum Mainnet
- Arbitrum
- Optimism
- Polygon
- Gnosis
- Avalanche
- Goerli (Testnet)
- Sepolia (Testnet)

Be sure to check their documentation for latest updates regarding their contracts and deployment addresses:
- [Balancer Documentation](https://docs.balancer.fi/)
- [Balancer Flash Loans](https://docs.balancer.fi/guides/arbitrageurs/flash-loans.html) 

### Additional Notes

- If testing out the *manipulate.js* script, you'll also want to update the **UNLOCKED_ACCOUNT** variable and adjust **AMOUNT** as needed.
